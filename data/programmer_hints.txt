- Consider structuring your code to separate the problem-solving logic from the input/output handling, allowing for more efficient and modular code that can be easily maintained and improved.(Weight: 90)
- Keep your code modular and maintainable by breaking down complex problems into smaller sub-problems that can be solved independently. Focus on creating self-explanatory functions with clear input-output relationships and minimal side effects. This will not only improve readability but also facilitate debugging, testing, and future modifications.(Weight: 95)
- Consider implementing a code quality enhancement framework that encourages iterative improvement and continuous learning. This can include regular code reviews, self-assessments, and peer feedback to foster growth and improvement in overall code quality.(Weight: 90)
- Focus on modularizing and separating concerns in your code, aiming for a balance between concise and readable logic. This will make it easier to maintain, debug, and scale your codebase as you continue to develop and evolve your project.(Weight: 90)
- Hint: Always consider the broader implications of your code's performance and scalability, even if it meets current requirements. Think about how changes in input data, system resources, or future functionality might affect your code's efficiency and optimization.(Weight: 90)
- Focus on developing a coding style that balances conciseness with clarity and maintainability. Consider using meaningful variable names, blank lines to separate logical sections of code, and comments to explain complex decisions or algorithms.(Weight: 80)
- Strive to write code that is modular, self-explanatory, and adaptable for future modifications. This involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller functions, providing clear and concise documentation, and using meaningful variable names. Consider the implications of your design choices on code readability, maintainability, and scalability.(Weight: 85)
- Hint: Focus on writing code that is modular, flexible, and maintainable by following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). This will help ensure that your functions have a clear purpose, are easy to understand, and can be reused in different contexts.(Weight: 85)
